# ITU Deep Learning Course Term Project
---
This repository contains the code, experiments, and report of course project of Deep Learning (BLG561E) course at Istanbul Technical University. The project builds upon YOLO-World, a real-time open-vocabulary object detector, and investigates how vocabulary construction and prompting strategies affect detection performance.

## Disclaimer

This repository is an academic course project and does not claim ownership of the YOLO-World model, codebase, or original methodology. All core model architectures, training procedures, and implementation details belong to the original authors of **YOLO-World: Real-Time Open-Vocabulary Object Detection**.

This repository builds upon the publicly available YOLO-World implementation and is intended solely for experimental analysis and educational purposes. Any results, observations, or discussions presented here reflect independent experimental evaluations and do not represent claims of improvement over the original work.
